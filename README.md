## Introduction to Crypto

Cryptocurrency is a form of digital money that works without banks.
People can send and receive value directly, without intermediaries.

Crypto transactions are recorded on a public system called a blockchain.
This makes transactions transparent and hard to change.

### Simple Analogy

Think of blockchain as a shared notebook.
Everyone can see the records, but no one can secretly change them.

### Real-Life Example

Crypto can be used to send money to another country in minutes,
without banks, delays, or high fees.

## Blockchain Basics

Blockchain is a decentralized database that stores transaction records.
It is shared across many computers instead of being controlled by one entity.

Each transaction is grouped into a block.
Blocks are connected to each other, forming a secure chain of data.
