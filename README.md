## Introduction to Crypto

Cryptocurrency is a form of digital money that works without banks.
People can send and receive value directly, without intermediaries.

Crypto transactions are recorded on a public system called a blockchain.
This makes transactions transparent and hard to change.

### Simple Analogy

Think of blockchain as a shared notebook.
Everyone can see the records, but no one can secretly change them.
