# Crypto Wallets

This document explains what crypto wallets are and how to use them safely.

## What Is a Crypto Wallet

A crypto wallet is a tool that allows you to store, send, and receive cryptocurrency.
A wallet does not store coins directly.
It stores private keys that give access to your funds.

## Types of Wallets

There are different types of crypto wallets depending on how they are used.

### Hot Wallets

Hot wallets are connected to the internet and are easy to use.
Examples include mobile apps, browser extensions, and web wallets.

### Cold Wallets

Cold wallets are not connected to the internet and offer higher security.

They include hardware wallets and paper wallets.
Hot wallets are convenient for daily use,
while cold wallets are better for long-term storage.

## Custodial Wallets

Custodial wallets are managed by exchanges or platforms.
The service controls the private keys, not the user.

## Non-Custodial Wallets

Non-custodial wallets give full control to the user.
Only the owner has access to the private keys.

## Seed Phrase

A seed phrase is a list of words used to recover a wallet.
Anyone with this phrase can access your funds.

Seed phrases should be stored offline in a secure place.

## Wallet Security Basics

Security is critical when using crypto wallets.
Never share your private keys or seed phrase.
Beware of phishing websites and fake apps.
Always use official wallet software and keep it updated.
Create backups to avoid losing access to your funds.
Use strong and unique passwords for wallet access.
Enable two-factor authentication whenever possible.
Always send a small test transaction first.
